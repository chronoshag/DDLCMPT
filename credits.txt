The MPT (Mood Pose Tool) has the following people to thank for it existing:

Chronos - Got pissed off at posing enough to start development on the system.
Yagamirai - Really good artist wot made a bunch of art for this.
Terra - Helped with a lot of the coding stuff when it was over Chronos' head.
DiabloGraves - Helped with testing and input.

Also, obviously, Team Salvato for DDLC in general.  Visit them at http://teamsalvato.com/ and please support the official release of DDLC at https://ddlc.moe/ .
